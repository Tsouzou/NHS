Below is a concise outline of what your final report must include, based on the instructions provided. The report, titled **“Longitudinal Analysis of Antidepressant Prescribing,”** should be split into two main parts (with an optional extension):

---

## **Part One: Overall National and Regional Figures**

1. **Annual Prescribing Bar Charts**
   - Create:
     - A vertical bar chart showing *total annual antidepressant prescribing (items)*.
     - A vertical bar chart showing *total annual antidepressant prescribing cost*.
   - **Explain**:
     - Describe the observed trends separately (e.g., do prescriptions increase or decrease each year?).
     - Compare the trends for *items vs. cost* (e.g., does cost change at a different rate than the number of items?).

2. **Annual Prescribing Tables (Regional)**
   - Create:
     - A table showing *total annual antidepressant prescribing per region (items)*.
     - A table showing *annual antidepressant prescribing cost per region*.
   - **Explain**:
     - Highlight any standout differences or shifts in prescribing between 2021 and 2024.
     - Note any regions with particularly high or low prescribing levels vs. cost.

3. **Top 10 Prescribed Drugs (Items vs. Cost)**
   - Create:
     - A horizontal bar chart of the **10 most prescribed** antidepressants (items) over the four-year period.
     - A horizontal bar chart of the **10 highest-cost** antidepressants over the same period.
   - **Explain**:
     - Focus on any differences in ranking between the volume of items and total cost.
     - Point out where a drug is high in items but not so high in cost (or vice versa).

*Keep the text flowing logically from these results to Part Two.*

## **Part Two: Longitudinal (Monthly) Analysis**

1. **Monthly Trend Analysis**
   - Analyze the *monthly trend* for:
     - Total antidepressant items prescribed
     - Total antidepressant prescribing cost
   - Decide which charts/visuals best illustrate changes over time (e.g., line charts).

2. **Identify Key Drugs Driving Trends**
   - From the monthly data, determine which drugs are causing the most significant shifts, either:
     - Largest absolute number of items
     - Largest cost
     - Rapid increase or decrease month-to-month
   - Use any combination of tables/charts to support your conclusions.

3. **Summary of Findings**
   - Provide a **high-level summary** that ties together the monthly trends and identifies clear patterns or anomalies.

---

## **Part Two Extension (Optional): Deeper Dive into Specific Antidepressants**

- **Choose one (or more) antidepressants** that play a significant role in overall volume or cost.  
- Possible analyses include (but are not limited to):
  1. **Percentage of total** antidepressant volume or cost contributed by your chosen drug(s).  
  2. **Mean cost per item** across months or years.  
  3. **Distribution** of mean cost per item (e.g., boxplots).  
  4. Any other creative or relevant metrics that highlight prescribing patterns.
- Conclude with a **summary** explaining how these insights affect the broader national/regional understanding of prescribing costs and volumes.

---

### **Putting It All Together**
- **Narrative Flow**: Ensure each section transitions smoothly and logically into the next (e.g., Part One findings might shape what you investigate in Part Two).  
- **Visuals & Tables**: Label your charts clearly, include brief descriptive titles or captions, and refer to them in your text.  
- **Key Takeaways**: Highlight practical implications for health services, such as areas or drugs that might need policy attention due to volume or cost trends.

By following these steps, you will have a structured, data-driven report that clearly outlines both the overall trends in antidepressant prescribing (Part One) and deeper monthly or drug-specific insights (Part Two/Extension).
